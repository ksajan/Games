## Games
*These games are based on javascript. I am building some retro games using javascript to learn javascript. This repository is based on the freecodecamp [!tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc).

Apart from the 7 games that are built on this tutorial, I will keep on adding some other games which require javascript and can be used later purpose.*
